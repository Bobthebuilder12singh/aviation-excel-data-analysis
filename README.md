Scenario Based Questions
Scenario 1:
The company is launching a subscription service where customers can subscribe to receive products every month at a discounted rate. They want to understand how the retention of subscription customers compares to regular customers who do not subscribe.
Question 1:
How would you compare the retention rates of subscription customers versus non-subscription customers? What metrics would you focus on, and how would you structure the cohort analysis?
Hint: Divide the customers into two cohorts (subscription vs non-subscription) and track retention over multiple months. Look at metrics such as average order frequency, repeat purchase rates, and customer lifetime value (CLV).
Question 2:
Suppose you find that subscription customers have a 20% higher retention rate after 3 months compared to non-subscription customers. What recommendations would you make to the business based on this finding?
Hint: Consider how the company can capitalise on this insight by encouraging more customers to subscribe, offering promotions, or improving the subscription model.
Scenario 2:
The company is testing two different landing pages for new users. Version A emphasises discounted products, while Version B highlights the quality and premium nature of products. The company wants to know which version drives more conversions (i.e., purchases).
Question 1:
How would you design an A/B test to determine which landing page (Version A or Version B) performs better in terms of conversion rate?
Hint: Define the key metrics (conversion rate), ensure random assignment of users to each version, and run the test over a statistically significant period.
Question 2:
After running the A/B test, you find that Version B has a higher conversion rate, but the difference is not statistically significant. What would you do next? Should the company adopt Version B, or continue with Version A?
Hint: Consider sample size, test duration, and whether further testing (e.g., multivariate testing or extending the test period) might be necessary to confirm the result.
